    <br>
    For most of my things, you can find me under the username of "Alexatawesomeaj"
    <br> However for some things, I am under different usernames... You'll find that here!
    <br> These accounts are also in the public space, so feel free to check them out!

    <br> I do all sorts of things, and I would appreciate it if you came and said hi!

    <img src="InstaLogo.png" height="40" width="40">
    <br> Instagram is an app I use occassionally to post random things
    <br> It can sometimes  be streams I plan on running
    <br> Usually its just stupid things that I decide to post
    <br> Generally its a good time <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alexatawesomeaj/">You can find that here</a>
    <br>

    <br>
    <img src="TwitterLogo.png" height="40" width="40">
    <br> Twitter... Yea this is an app
    <br> I mostly lurk on here, but will occassionally announce things
    <br> Usually nothing important...
    <br> I use this account to lurk around and do wild things
    <br> If you really want it... here it is: <a href="https://x.com/Alexatawesomeaj">Twitter</a>

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@alexatawesomeaj"><img src="YoutubeLogo.png" height="40" width="57"></a>
    <br> Youtube is an app! I post vods, little videos, and maybe regular videos
    <br> But for now, its just a service that I have! Feel free to check it out, there's nothing good!
    <br> The link is hidden somewhere obvious... but not too obvious. Try clicking around :)
    <br>

    <br>
    <img src="DiscordLogo.png" height="40" width="40">
    <br> Now here's a cool one! This is discord, a service that I use too often!
    <br> This server is where I announce things, like when I go live on twitch, youtube videos, and more!
    <br> Its a pretty cool place to join and chat around in... if that's your style!
    <br> <a href="https://discord.com/invite/GjHGKDJrxr">Join here!</a>
