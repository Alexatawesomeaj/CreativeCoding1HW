# Final Project Proposal
Hey all, Alex here. 4/28/24

For my final project I would like to attempt to make a game using p5.js and implement a sound mixer into it.
    It will be a simple platformer game, involving color-changing platforms and moving some platforms in time with the music
        * This would involve knowledge of how to change colors of shapes/objects, and moving objects (which I have prior knowledge of)
        * This would also involve knowledge of how to implement collision between a character and an object (I do not have prior knowledge of)
    I would use simple sprites with basic animations that I create, as well as music that I find.

My initial inspiration would come from a game like Celeste, with a second-person perspective and rooms that the player moves through
Players would be able to lower or raise the volume of music to change the amount that platforms move, as well as changing the colors of platforms
to be sharper colors/designs with louder music, and softer colors/designs with softer music, and then more in-between.

The game would be short, think game-jam level of content. The music would likely be taken from a game named "Heartbound" (by Pirate Software), because all of the music in the game is released for public use.
Some initial concerns would be learning the collisions, as well as transitions between rooms. Implementing a gravity/momentum system would be difficult, if I choose to allow moving platforms to launch the player.

Basic timeline:
    Create collisions/playerCharacter - 4/29
    Create audio sync - 5/1
    Create proof-of-concept level - 5/2
    Create 5 levels for the base game - 5/5
    Create Style for objects, player, and background - 5/7
    + Create more levels
    + Create level select
    + Create alternative keybind support
(+ items are for if time allows)
(all dates are hopeful estimates, but will be done before the date after)

As of writing this, I am starting on the *basic* basics of the game, but have done no prior work prior to this on this project

If time allows, I would also add support to changing keybinds to different keys, as well as adding a few different color pallets into the game.
