# Final Project Proposal
Hey all, Alex here. 4/28/24

For my final project I would like to attempt to make a game using p5.js and implement a sound mixer into it.
    It will be a simple platformer game, involving color-changing platforms and moving some platforms in time with the music
        * This would involve knowledge of how to change colors of shapes/objects, and moving objects
        * This would also involve knowledge of how to implement collision between a character and an object
    I would use simple sprites with basic animations that I create, as well as music that I find.

My initial inspiration would come from a game like Celeste, with a second-person perspective and rooms that the player moves through
Players would be able to lower or raise the volume of music to change the amount that platforms move, as well as changing the colors of platforms
to be sharper colors/designs with louder music, and softer colors/designs with softer music, and then more in-between.

The game would be short, think game-jam level of content.

If time allows, I would also add support to changing keybinds to different keys, as well as adding a few different color pallets into the game.

//Sorry if this isn't how a proposal is supposed to be written, i've never done this before... thanks for reading anyways!
