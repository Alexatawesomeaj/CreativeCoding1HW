Learning styles are a difficult subject to reach, because there's a lot of preconceived ideas about it, because everyone has been taught
about them for a very long time, probably sense elementary. At an elementary level, having a base of the 4 learning styles could be handy,
for example I know that some younger kids learn better when given a book and told to read, and others who can't fathom reading a book for
more than 2 seconds, but that's where it stops. Emelementary education. As people get older, they may still have a preference of how to learn,
like I don't really like being given long forms of text to read and summarize (these articles aren't that!), but if I am given something
like that it won't stop me from learning the subject. And, while people may have a preference, as they get older that preference will be
less of what they like and more of what takes the shortest time. I do like the concept of learning styles for younger youth, but it shouldn't
reach much beyond that.
