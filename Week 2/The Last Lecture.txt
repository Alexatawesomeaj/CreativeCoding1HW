Although the video was long, I found that it was not difficult to listen to at all, with the whole premise being that people should follow
their childhood dreams, and when they cna't do that any more, help others along the process of discovering and fulfilling theirs. The
lecture was very powerful, in the way both that Randy Pausch is a very good speaker, and also the fact that that lecture may very well be
his last, as he was dying from cancer. I found a lot of what he was saying powerful, as I am still young and he really said things that I
wanted to hear, and also was similar along the lines to what I'm trying to do with my life. Learning how to code, how to design, and also
just college in general have been really big dreams of mine for my entire life, and this lecture reasured me that doing what I want sometimes
is not a bad thing. It also wasn't boring in the slightest. It had humor, heart, and it had power/logic to back it all up. Overall, I did
really like the last lecture, and the very effective way it conveyed its message.
